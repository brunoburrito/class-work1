                    There are over 500 million domestic cats in the world. Cats and humans have been associated for nearly 10000 years. Cats
                    conserve energy by sleeping for an average of 13 to14 hours a day. Cats have flexible bodies and teeth adapted for
                    hunting small animals such as mice and rats.

                <p>Cats have about 473 taste buds, which is far fewer than people (we have 9,000) or dogs (who have 1,700). Cats can taste
                savory, salty, bitter, and sour flavors, but they don’t taste sweets.

                <p>
                    Dogs have a sense of time but don’t understand the ‘concept’ of time. Unlike humans, dogs don’t have
                    the ability to create actual measures of time, like the second, hour, and minute, and they don’t
                    know how to read clocks. So, telling them ”I’ll be back in 15 minutes” won’t really do much, but we
                    understand that you feel like you have to do it anyway! Dogs are capable of being trained based on
                    past events, and can be taught to anticipate future events based on past experiences. Pavlov’s dogs
                    are the perfect example of this.

                    The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from
                    extinct Pleistocene wolves, and the modern wolf is the dog's nearest living relative. Dogs were the
                    first species to be domesticated by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago before the development of
                    agriculture.
